Error: No configuration files

Plan requires configuration to be present. Planning without a configuration
would mark everything for destruction, which is normally not what is desired.
If you would like to destroy everything, run plan with the -destroy option.
Otherwise, create a Terraform configuration file (.tf file) and try again.
